In this task, a simple exploratory data analysis and model building for time series data using ***R*** has been presented step by step (please see [Analysis](Analysis.md) part).  The [dataset](international-airline-passengers.csv) can be downloaded for free from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andreazzini/international-airline-passengers) or [Datamarket](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22u3/international-airline-passengers-monthly-totals-in-thousands-jan-49-dec-60#!ds=22u3&display=line). We want to train a model to predict the number of airline passengers. Upon completing a model, we are able to predict the passengers for the dates in [test file](test_predicion.csv).
